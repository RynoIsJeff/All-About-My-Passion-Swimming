# All-About-My-Passion-Swimming
## Project Description
This is my final Capstone Project for level 1 of my Immersive Full Stack Web & Software Development Bootcamp. It displays all the coding knowledge I have built so far as well as my Passion for my favourite sport, Swimming.
## Installation Guide
Simply download all files from this repository into a single folder on your device and it should work as intended without any problems.
## Usage Guide
Start by opening the index.html file (as it is the home page), from here you'll have access to various buttons that each serve their own function. The Menu button allows for navigation between pages. There are save for later buttons situated throughout the different pages which each save a section. When navigating to the Save Items page you'll have access to all your saved items which when clicked on redirects to the top of that section.

Enjoy!
