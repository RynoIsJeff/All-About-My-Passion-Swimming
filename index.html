      <h2>How Swimming competitions work</h2>
      <p>
        Swimmers are grouped into heats based upon their seeded times, and heats for each event progress from slowest to fastest. 
        At larger meets, men and women swim in separate heats. At smaller meets, they may simply be grouped together based upon their seeded times.
        You also get long course and short course events (in the US you get Short Course Yards as well), in this case your fastest time 
        will always be converted to the length of the pool you are swimming in.
