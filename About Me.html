                I'm a 19-year old South African swimmer, and business owner. My passion has always been swimming, even though I'm only a level 3 athlete.
                I've featured in numerous articles of the Zululand Observer.

                            <li>After missing Olympic qualification at the 2021 South African Championships in April, Sates competed at the Cana Grand Prix the following month, 
                                where he hit the FINA ‘A’ cut in the 200 IM, qualifying him for his first Olympic Games. Later that month, he also hit the ‘A’ cut in the 100 fly 
                                at the Grand Prix in Durban.</li>
                            <li>In Tokyo at the Olympic Games, Sates qualified for the semi-finals of the 200 IM out of prelims (15th, 1:58.08) and ultimately wound up placing 
                                14th overall (1:58.75). The next day, he swam prelims of the 100 fly, placing 32nd overall (52.43).</li>

                            <li>After one semester at Georgia, Sates decided to end his very brief NCAA career. On April 14, 2022, Sates turned pro, 
                                signing with the Newton Agency and returning to his hometown of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa to train. 
                                Sates had only arrived at the University of Georgia in the U.S. in January 2022, spending roughly 3 months with the Bulldogs before making this decision.</li>
